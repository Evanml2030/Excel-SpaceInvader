# SpaceInvader
VBA version of a classic game

This code runs from Excel

.frx file must in same directory as .frm file to be able to import the frm file

You must also place all of the "skins" for the space objects, the jpgs, inside the same directory as the excel file that you are launching this from. We are uploading via code that reads  ActiveWorkbook.Path & "\SpaceShip.jpg", ActiveWorkbook.Path & "Missile.jpg" etc

Refactored and now functional

The stopwatch was created by the author of http://bytecomb.com/, a great tool

The clip art comes from https://openclipart.org/

Want to work on the presenter class, add heat seeking missiles, shields and a raid boss before I "finish" project.
