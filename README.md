# SpaceInvader
VBA version of a classic game

Will not run unless you change the pathways to image that will be uploaded into form controls.
You can find these inside Ship.cls, MissleFactory, AlienFactory, CometFactory, StarFactory

Obviously needs some basic refactoring, finished over weekend and havent had time to fix up. 
Will do if not during week then definitely this weekend.
I am thinking of implementing an ShipWeapons interface, to allow of different sort of weapons.
Maybe "heat seeking" style missle or something.
Also shields? More types of spaceObjects. And I was thinking of making some spaceObjects indestructible. 
Maybe make some spaceObjects ie the sun increase in size momentarily after being struck. 

Etc Etc.
